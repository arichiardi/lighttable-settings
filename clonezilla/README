# Clonezilla S3/Backblaze configuration

Following Clonezilla's own instructions, we store an encrypted .passwd-s3fs.enc in Backblaze that we
then retrieve with curl from within Clonezilla Live.

In order to generate that URL, once the backblaze-b2 is authorized, run:

```shell
backblaze-b2 make-friendly-url secrets-f3ba7cb4 .passwd-s3fs.enc
```

Alternatively login to the UI and get a link to the file from there.

When Clonezilla Live stops and asks you to run the s3fs command, run something like this for
retrieving the file:

```shell
curl -fsSL -o- $url > /root/.passwd-s3fs.enc
openssl enc -decrypt -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -in /root/.passwd-s3fs.enc -out /root/.passwd-s3fs
```

There is a binary in this folder that does the above for you. You can copy it to the Clonezilla Live
USB drive for convenience.

Use [these instructions](https://clonezilla.org/liveusb.php) for creating a read/write USB drive.
